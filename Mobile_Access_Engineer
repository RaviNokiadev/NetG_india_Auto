1- What planning tools have you used in your previous projects?
2. Can you explain how you plan a new 4G/5G site?
Answer:
Site planning involves analyzing site grid data, traffic demand, and clutter type. I assess nearby site performance, decide antenna height, tilt, and azimuth,
then simulate coverage using Atoll. Based on that, I finalize the configuration and work with implementation teams for execution.

Q2 -What factors do you consider for site selection in 5G planning?
Ans- I look at user density, existing coverage gaps, line-of-sight (LOS) for mmWave, and backhaul availability. Also, spectrum band (low/mid/high) and the type of environment (urban/rural) greatly influence site suitability.

Q3- Have you worked with both NSA and SA 5G? What's the difference?
I’ve worked with both. NSA (Non-Standalone) relies on LTE for control plane and anchors data through NR. SA (Standalone) is independent with a dedicated 5G core and enables ultra-low latency and advanced features like slicing. 
I optimized KPIs in both architectures, focusing on different interworking scenarios.

Q4 - You’ve mentioned experience with NetAct and U2020
 Q-5 Which parameters are filled while doing the data fill for a new BTS in the BSC?

******************* Traffic utilization **********
received_total_octets	transmitted_total_octets	capacity_new	max	utilization
5	3	10	5	50
6	4	10	6	60
7	6	100	7	7
8	7	10	8	80
7.6484E-05	8	10	8	80

3.	BSC Signalling Unit (BCXU): Abis and AOIP signalling.
4.	Packet Control Unit (PCUM): GPRS/EDGE functions.
5.	Transport Termination Unit for Abis (ETME): Abis User Plane termination.
6.	Transport Termination Unit for A (ETMA): AOIP user plane termination.
7.	General Purpose Linux Unit (GPLU): Hosts the connectivity towards the external NTP server. This is also a new addition as compared to earlier mcBSC.
